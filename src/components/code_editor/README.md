# vue-monaco-editor

[![Vue](https://img.shields.io/badge/Vue-3.3.4-success)](https://cn.vuejs.org/)

This project aims at packaging [Monaco Editor](https://github.com/microsoft/monaco-editor) into a **Vue3** component.

You can easily use this project in your own Vue3 project as a web code editor, which provides exactly the same experience as **vscode** thanks to **Monaco Editor**.

After several days of api testing, i choose to use code from [codeplayground](https://github.com/wobsoriano/codeplayground) directly to implement and refator it.

Thanks to [**codeplayground**](https://github.com/wobsoriano/codeplayground) a lot!
